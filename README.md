# dialect_detector

This dialect detector predicts which dialect of Spanish a given piece of text is from. 
It was trained on text data from two sources (childes.talkbank.cmu and radioambulante.org).

To use the dialect detector:
1. Launch the project in Binder (may take several minutes): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HannahForsythe/dialect_detector.git/master)
2. open the jupyter notebook 'capstone.ipyn' 
3. run the cell under the phrase "Type sentence, get dialect."
