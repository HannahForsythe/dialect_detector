# dialect_detector

This dialect detector predicts which dialect of Spanish a given piece of text is from. 
It was trained on text data from two sources (childes.talkbank.cmu and radioambulante.org).

To use the dialect detector, open the jupyter notebook and run the cell under the phrase "Type sentence, get dialect."
